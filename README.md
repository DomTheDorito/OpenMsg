# OpenMsg
Simple program to send and receive message via the APRS Network

**This project is in its infancy. Expect bugs to happen**

This software takes in a senders callsign and message, formats it to an APRS message, sends it to the APRS network, and to the destinatoin callsign.

**PREREQUISITES**

-Python (duh)

-Internet Connection

-Patience with the developers

-Valid Amateur Radio Callsign and APRS passcode. (Magicbug has a great APRS passcode generator available here: https://github.com/magicbug/PHP-APRS-Passcode)


# To Do

1. Group messages from callsigns together into an "inbox" style
2. Allow users to click on a message to reply to.
3. Automatically provide an ack back to the recievers radio to it stops retrying.
